# 3D Printed Iron Man Helmet

## Summary

I am Going to build a Inron man Helmet that is motorized, It opens and closes smoothly by using servo motors, I am a huge Marvel Fan and once 
I saw a Video about a Iron Man Helmet that closes and opens automatically via voice commands + touch It Looked Pretty Cool and I want one but I can't so I decided
to Build one 

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? 
I am Going to follow 'https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5137286/files' this guide and going to build it

What tools are you going to use?
I am gussing that I will need a Arduino, Some Servos and a 3D Printer

What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
Firstly I need aquire the Parts that I Require like 3D Printer, Servos  
Secondly Print the 3D parts and Joint them 
Thirdly do all the connections and attach the servos to thier right place
